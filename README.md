# Galeria
### A React JS gallery app using [Imgur Gallery API](https://api.imgur.com/endpoints/gallery)

Technologies Used
 - ES6
 - React JS
 - Redux
 - Node JS (Server Proxy)
 - Express JS
 - SASS
 - Material UI
 - Gulp
 - Docker
 - Webpack
 
### Steps to run
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ Open http://localhost:3012 in browser
```

### Notes
 1. Albums are not shown(filtered) in the gallery 
 2. Scroll to load more data is implemented
 
### Future Improvements planned
 1. Scroll to pagination can be improved, as the Imgur API return more than 700 records from page 1 onwards which is a performance issue,
 2. Add Unit and e2e tests
